# FrontEnd
INTRODUCTION:
The Pintreach app is built for users who want to save and organize articles/studies they have read into categories. This app keep track of articles saved to a user's board, and allows them to search for articles within the Community.              

Mission statement: Empower people to discover things they love (and keep them).

WEBSITE:
The site is deployed and live at: https://frontend.pintreach.now.sh/

HOW PINTREACH WORKS:
Users must register through the signup page and login. Once they have finished registration and have logged in, the user is redirected to a home page where they can add or delete articles. They can also view the Community page of articles, and search for any new articles in the Community by title.
